          <p>Cape Cod Seed Coop exists solely for the purpose to help create a resilient seed and food system in our region, connect gardeners and growers and to help adapt crops to our ever changing climate here on Cape Cod. Money is not exchanged here, but ideas and seeds are. </p>
              
        

           <h5>We Work With Open Pollinated Seed</h5>
             <p>Open pollinated varieties can and will adapt to the area they are grown in and with our ever changing climate it is becoming more important.  With open pollinated seeds, you get a greater amount of variation within a plant population. This allows plants to slowly adapt to local growing conditions and is what we are seeking here.
            None of the seed listed here is hybrid (F1), patented or genetically modified (GMO). We aspire to keep the seed in the hands of gardeners and small farmers rather than in the hands of multi-national corporations that erode biodiversity with patenting schemes. </p>

        <h5>Money is not exchanged here</h5>
          <p>We are an all volunteer based cooperative and are working towards a common goal, which is adapting seed to our local region. Every one is volunteering their time and energy for good of the future of Cape Cod's.  We want to share ideas and also come together as a community of gardeners and seed growers to help adapt crops to the ever-changing growing seasons we have. </p>
            
        <h5>Why not just purchase seed from companies, why should I save seed? </h5>
          <p>The climate is changing rapidly on Cape Cod - we are now seeing the growing season start later and end right up until Christmas depending on what the year looks like. WE are surrounded by the ocean which will mean that we will be effected more quickly by climate change.  This year we are not getting alot of precipitation in the winter (2019). We are not sure what that means for crops coming up this spring, but we will see.  Seed you purchase from far away companies is grown in areas that are not very similar to Cape Cod - they might be drier, mountainous, hotter, colder, etc. These seed crops can be grown in non-organic systems that use heavy pesticides and once they are started in your garden, they have to adapt quickly (and some don't).  </p>
